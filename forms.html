    <h1>Travel Suggestions</h1>
    <!--
            the form tag is used to create a container where all the imputs for a form must be put inside.
            the attributes that are required are name, id, and method.

            name gives some descriptive information about what the form will be used for.

            id allows us to reference this form later in fieldsets and other areas of our code.

            method has two typical values: get and post. get is used for forms that do not ask personal information(search bars, etc).
            Post is used for forms that ask for personal information(login and signup pages, etc)

        <!--
            this is a text input. type="text", name, and id are all required attributes.
            the required attribute is only neccesary when you want to make sure the user has to fill in the input before submittint the form.

            the type attribute defines the type of input.
            the name attribut defines the variable name that would be used for the input when the data gets passed to the server(requires back-end 
            scripting, which is beyond the scope of this course).
            the id attribute allows us to reference the input rom the label and form other parts of our code.

            all inputs need a label with the for attribute that links the label to the input using the input's id attribut.
            when an input is required, itis important to includethe word required in the label's text.
